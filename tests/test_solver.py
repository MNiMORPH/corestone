"""
The solver's shortcuts, and the properties they depend on.

Every routine here is about *cost*, not physics -- but each one is fast only
because the matrix has some property, and a property assumed is a property that
will eventually stop holding. So each shortcut is paired with a test of the
thing it relies on, and with a test that it still gives the same answer as the
plain method it replaced.
